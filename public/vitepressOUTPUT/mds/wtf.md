    Dear Copyright Clearance Center (CCC) Team,

      

    We are writing to formally request permission to use copyrighted

    Specifically, We are interested in utilizing excerpts from Williams
    Gynecology, 4e; Schwartz's Principles of Surgery, 11e; Harrison's
    Principles of Internal Medicine, 21e or 15e for integration into an
    online medical learning platform for general medical students in
    Taiwan, with a subscription model and special provisions for
    Indigenous, economically disadvantaged, and DEI community members.

      

    The content will be used strictly for a combination of academic and
    commercial purposes, ensuring accessibility for underprivileged
    groups, and proper acknowledgment will be given in accordance with
    McGraw Hill Medical’s guidelines. If required, We will comply with
    any licensing terms or conditions specified.

      

    Please let me know the necessary steps to obtain official permission
    and whether there are any associated requirements. We would

<span style="font-family:Arial;color:#222222">Hi Ivan,</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;color:#222222">Thank you for your
reply.</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;color:#222222">Can you please tell me
approximately how many case images you are anticipating needing?</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;color:#222222">We can offer the
below bulk rates for purchases of \>24 case images, but could look at
discounting these rates further, depending on how many images you
require.</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;color:#222222">Alternatively, you could
contact case authors directly, outlining your project and asking if you
have their permission to use their case image free of charge. If you do
use this option, then you will need to tell the case authors
that Radiopaedia has suggested this, otherwise they will loop you back
to us </span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;color:#222222;font-weight:bold">Bulk
Image Pricing:</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;color:#222222">The case images do not
need to be selected all at once; you can choose to make an initial
payment of at least 24 cases and then we will record the number of case
image requests as you send them through until you reach the total you
have paid for. </span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;color:#222222">Any number of subsequent
purchases can be purchased at the USD \$50 per case image rate once the
initial payment of 1-24 case images has been made. </span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;color:#222222">I hope that all makes
sense but do let me know if you need any clarification!</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;color:#222222;font-weight:bold">For
the first 1 to12 cases images = USD \$100 per case (= \$1200)</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;color:#222222;font-weight:bold">Then USD
\$75 per case image for no's 13 to 24 (= \$900)</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial;color:#222222;font-weight:bold">Then USD
\$50 per case image for no's 25 onward</span>

Minimum purchase of 24 cases required initially to secure the bulk
rate</span>

helps</span>
